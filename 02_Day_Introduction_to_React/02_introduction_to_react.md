If you have the skills mentioned above, you will enjoy doing React. The 30 Days Of React challenge contains everything you need to know about react. In every section, it has some exercises and mini-projects, and it is recommended to work on them. This 30 Days Of React challenge will help you learn the latest version of React and the old version, step by step. The topics are broken down into 30 days, where each day contains several topics with easy-to-understand explanations, real-world examples and many hands-on exercises.
This challenge is designed for beginners and professionals who want to build a web application using React and JavaScript.
Once in a while you may need different dummy data to work with React. You can use the following [dummy data generator](https://www.30daysofreact.com/dummy-data) to generate different data.

### 1. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building a reusable user interface(UI). It was initially released on May 29, 2013. The current version is 16.13.1 and somehow it is stable. React was created by Facebook. React makes creating UI components very easy. The official React documentation can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). When we work with React we do not interact directly with the DOM. React has its own way to handle the DOM(Document Object Model) manipulation. React uses its virtual DOM to make new changes and it updates only the element, that needs changing. Do not directly interact with DOM when you build a React Application and leave the DOM manipulation job for the React virtual DOM. In this challenge, we will develop 10-15 web applications using React. A web application, or a website, is made of buttons, links, forms with different input fields, header, footer, sections, articles, texts, images, audios, videos and boxes with different shapes. We use react to make a reusable UI components of a website.
